# Motion-Capture-System

This is the repo that I used for my thesis work.

The system is able to use Raspberry Pi's to record stereo videos. The videos are the processed for aruco marker detection and the location of the marker is tracked through space.

The aim of the project was to study the tracking accuracy of a stereo vision motion capture system and understand how the error is related to the system setup.
